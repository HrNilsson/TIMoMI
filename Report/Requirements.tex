\chapter{Requirements}
The main requirement of the system is quite simple; The customer should be able to buy groceries without help from any personnel. This requirement is split into five smaller more detailed requirements:

\begin{enumerate}[label=R.\arabic*:]
\item The customer should be able to scan products with barcodes.
\item The customer should be able to specify a multiple of products, when scanned.
\item The customer should be able to pay with cash and with credit card.
\item The customer should be able to cancel a payment.
\item The system should print a receipt, when all groceries have been payed for.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Delimitation}
When customers buy alcoholic beverage, they shall show picture identification. This is not possible in this system, since it requires some sort of personnel interaction. Therefore this is not a requirement.
